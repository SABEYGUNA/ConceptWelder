# Pair-programming with Kids

As a dad, I want to teach my kids the things I learned later in life, hoping they get a head start. One day, I decided to introduce my three kids to the world of programming, starting with HTML because I thought it would be easy. To my surprise, only one of them was interested.

I am always inspired by watching Dr. Ruchira Wijerathna's  ['Science With Ruchira'](https://www.youtube.com/@ScienceWithRuchira) YouTube channel. One day, I showed my kids his ['DIY Arduino RC Car'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7A0ICf_pa4) video (In Sinhala Language), as they are big fans of vehicles. 

[![Watch the video](/DIY%20Arduino%20RC%20Car%20%20-%20Sceince%20with%20Ruchira.PNG)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7A0ICf_pa4)

After watching the video, they asked me, "Can't we build one?" I thought it was a great opportunity to introduce them to programming and the basics of project management. 
I said, "Yes, you can build it yourselves. I can help." 
Their next question was, "How can we build such a vehicle ourselves?"

When I heard their question, I remembered what I learned from [Johanes Broadwell](https://github.com/jhannes) 10 years ago, He taught us that any project (or any task in a big project) can be achieved by breaking it down into four steps.
1. Experimental version
2. Basic version
3. Simplified version
4. Complete version
5. Enhanced version (Optional)

 Johannes wrote about that experimental approach in his blog under [Pair programming with Sankalpa](https://johannesbrodwall.com/2014/06/27/pair-programming-with-sankalpa/).
I applied the same technique in several software projects, and I have personally found it very effective.

I said 'Yes, you can build that in 4 steps'. 
1. Experimental jeep version.
2. Basic jeep version.
3. Simplified jeep version.
4. Complete jeep version.
5. Enhanced jeep version. (Optional)

Lets call it 'jeep', they named it.

Our goal was to build an all-terrain vehicle with a camera for real-time viewing.

First we started experimental jeep version. 

This phase's milestone is to have something controlled by an Arduino board.

To start the project, we checked what we had on hand. We had only one NodeMCU board and a laptop. I suggested ordering differentials and other required parts for the Jeep online, even though it might take some time for them to be delivered. But the kids said, "No, we have a differential from an old toy. We can build the chassis ourselves," the brothers insisted.

ESP8266 and two batteris.

Front and rear axle from old toy

![Rear axle](/Rear%20axle%202.jpg "Items found from home")

After spending 1-2 days on mechanical work, they came back with a chassis built from plastic bars, two different types of wheels, and a working front axle. The vehicle wasn't very solid, but it was enough for an experimental version. The front axle consisted of two motors: one for moving forward and backward, and another for turning left and right.

Then we tested both axle machanism with external power source, Only fron axle is completely working rear one have some machanical issue. 
And we could find two 1200mah batteries from old emergency lamp.
We start setting up Arduino IDE, and kids start with ['Blink'](https://blynk.io/) sample code and try to understand the code.  
And I asked to write some pseudo code of the program, Elder brather already learned that lesson in school. What they write is acceptable. 

Pseudo code

That was the first virtual sprint we ran.

Next day we together create a list of hardware items required. I shared the guideline article them then they complete the wiring of two motors, motor control, node mcu with battery pack.
We start our program and try to do run car forward for 5 seconds. After succssful with that. I asked them to complete the other movements. 
Our plan was to do Forward, reverse, turn-left and turn-rigth in given time period with small time gap.
After few round of test and bug fixing they could achive that.
Then I thought this is good time to introduce refactring. 
And we write first custom function to move car forward, with time period as parameter. And they have write other functions alone.
Thats the second sprint and Experimental jeep version.

They egally wating for this step to controll there 'jeep' remotly. And already watching some vedios how to do that have found they can do that using 'Blnk' platform.
First my plan was to build a web page and controlled 'jeep' over that, But I thought 'Blnk' is easy to understand them. 
Then we installed required library, download mobile app, and modify the code to support 'Blnk' with only forward. 
Code compiled but failed to upload to the module. Trying few more time but result was same.
Then we found issue is with board, we were using CH340 board which is less reliable than CP2102 board. 
We have to wait about 5-6 days till the new board received.

Re-start the project again, upload the code and tested. But 'jeep' only going forward, no turning or even not stopping regardless of what ever the command we sent. 
First we thought issue with the wiring, but later found issue with code it self. 
In code refactring they have copy and paste the same values to every function. 
Finally its working. 
They built there own remote controlled car.

I am going to stop here with the end of Basic jeep version. 
Simplified and complete version yet to come.
